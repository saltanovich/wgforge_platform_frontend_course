          of
          tanks</h3>
        <p>

          historically accurate armored vehicles. Experience driving a multi-ton, cannon-equipped
          behemoth into combat against teams of tankers from all over the world. World of Tanks:
          Xbox 360 Edition was made from the ground-up, with every part of the game ratcheted up
          for explosive showdowns like no other.

        <p>
          It's great to dream of being the ace who saves the day, but it's only through teamwork
          that you and your allies prevail. 30 tanks split between two teams battle for supremacy
          on over a dozen intricately-designed maps. Do your best to collaborate, and your allies
          will work with you to unleash an unstoppable assault against your enemies!

          game
          modes</h3>
        <p>
          World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition offers three distinct game modes: Standard, Encounter,
          and Assault. Standard battles are intense "capture" scenarios where two teams attempt to
          secure the opposing base. Encounter battles offer only one base to capture, and teams
          fight tooth-and-nail to keep it. In Assault mode, players get a pitched battle between
          attackers and defenders during a single-base engagement.
